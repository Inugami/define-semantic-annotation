2,"Setting boundaries is a life skill that has been popularized by self help authors and support groups since the mid 1980's. It is the practice of openly communicating and asserting personal values as way to preserve and protect against having them compromised or violated.[1] The term 'boundary' is a metaphor – with in-bounds meaning acceptable and out-of-bounds meaning unacceptable.[1] Without values and boundaries our identities become diffused and often controlled by the definitions offered by others.[2] The concept of boundaries has been widely adopted by the counseling profession.[3]"
2,"Boundaries of the mind refers to a personality trait concerning the degree of separateness ('thickness') or connection ('thinness') between mental functions and processes. Thin boundaries are associated with open-mindedness, sensitivity, vulnerability, creativity, and artistic ability. People with thin boundaries may tend to confuse fantasy and reality and tend to have a fluid sense of identity, so that they tend to merge or lose themselves in their relations with others. People with thick boundaries differentiate clearly between reality and fantasy and between self and other, and tend to prefer well-defined social structures.[1] The concept was developed by psychoanalyst Ernst Hartmann from his observations of the personality characteristics of frequent nightmare sufferers.[2] The construct has been particularly studied in relation to dream recall[3] and lucid dreaming.[4]"
4,"In topology and mathematics in general, the boundary of a subset S of a topological space X is the set of points which can be approached both from S and from the outside of S. More precisely, it is the set of points in the closure of S, not belonging to the interior of S. An element of the boundary of S is called a boundary point of S. The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd(S), fr(S), and ∂S. Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the term frontier, instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with the concept of boundary used in algebraic topology and manifold theory. However, frontier sometimes refers to a different set, which is the set of boundary points which are not actually in the set; that is, S \ S."
3,"Symbolic boundaries are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by cultural sociologists. Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.”[1]"
